            <h2>Cut Description</h2>
            <p> A diamond’s fire and sparkle that give it life are maximized with great cut allowing light to
refract from one facet to another then dispersed back through the top of the diamond in a burst 
of color and brightness.  When poorly cut, precious light escapes through the bottom facets.

There are millions of cutting combinations that will maximize the beauty of countless types of rough 
diamond crystals. And millions more will ruin the diamond’s potential beauty in an attempt to make the 
diamond weigh more so that it can be sold as a “bigger” diamond (weighing more, but visually not as big).

Comparing two diamonds with the same carat weight, the artistically cut diamond will have BOTH 
superior beauty and larger visual size than the standard cut diamond which was cut just 
to weigh more for advertising purposes. </p>

            <h2>Color Description </h2>
            <p>Color is the natural body color visible in a diamond, and is determined completely by nature ranging 
from colorless to yellow. Basically the less color, the more rare and higher the price (except for natural fancy 
colors, like pink or intense yellow diamonds) Color is expressed in a single letter. The highest 
diamond color available on the market is “D”; the diamond color you choose is what you personally prefer.</p>

            <h2>Clarity Description</h2>
            <p>Clarity is an indication of a diamond's purity. When a rough stone is extracted deep beneath the
earth, tiny traces of natural elements are almost always trapped inside. These “inclusions”, are
sometimes referred to as “birthmarks” because they are formed naturally and are unique to each diamond.

Skilled diamond artisans (diamantaires) painstakingly examine each rough stone to determine
how to cut it in order to eliminate or reduce inclusions and flaws. Their goal is to craft a diamond
of the highest clarity possible. The fewer, smaller, and less noticeable the inclusions, the more
rare and higher the price of the diamond.</p>

            <h2>Carat Weight Description</h2>
            <p> The weight of a diamond is expressed in carats. In most cases when holding other factors
constant, the higher the carat weight category, the greater the per-carat price of the diamond.
A carat is a unit of weight equaling 1/5 of a gram. Diamond weight is subdivided further into
smaller units commonly referred to as points. A point is equal to .01 carat. 
A one carat diamond is made up of 100 points. </p>
